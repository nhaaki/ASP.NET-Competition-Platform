#Competition Judging Platform (WEB Assignment)

This was a Year 2 IT Project for the module WEB, where I worked with my teammates Dandarawie, Jin Yang and Boon Chong to create an ASP.NET application that serves as a plaatform for competitors to submit their work, for judges to rate their works and for administrators to facilitate all of that.
